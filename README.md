# Health Service Platform Capability Statements

An HSP Capability statement is a static JSON document declaring the exposed interfaces and dependencies of an OCI container image, with special consideration given to standards specific to the healthcare industry. When a containerized health service is further annotated in this manner, it can be registered, programmatically validated and publicly published to the HSP Marketplace and compatible implementations. Further, an HIT professional will be able to deploy your service in their local HSP-compatible infrastructure via the autowiring features of the locally-installed HSP Agent.

This project is developed and maintained by HSPC and authoritatively documented on [the HSPC wiki](https://healthservices.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PE/Platform+Engineering).s

## Developer Happy Path Quick Start

Let's say you have a web service that provides an implementation of a FHIR STU3, and already have it built into an OCI container published to Docker Hub that satifies the HSPC service publication criteria and policies.
